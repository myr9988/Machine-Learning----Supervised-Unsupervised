    "There are many ways to create recommendation systems. To create an articles recommendation system, we need to focus on content rather than user interest. For example, if a user reads an article based on clustering, all recommended articles should also be based on clustering. So to recommend articles based on the content:\n",
    "\n",

It is used to find similarities between two different pieces of text documents. So we can use cosine similarity to build an article recommendation system. In the section below, I will take you through how to build an article recommendation system with machine learning using Python."
